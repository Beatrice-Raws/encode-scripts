## A few words...
Hi, guys!

I’m a new Beatrice-Raws encoder. My nickname is NekoCoder. Irl I’m a programmer. I watch anime and like kittens. I have passed a lo-o-o-ong way from just curious in encoding to doing one. I have already helped DJATOM in August with scening on “Kanojo to Kanojo no Neko: Everything Flows”, but “Ani Tore” is the first I've done myself. I’m planning to encode "Ani Tore! XX" next week. So, see you soon.

Thanks to DJATOM, Jensen and Urotsuki for answering my numerous questions about encode.  
Thanks to DJATOM for Python libraries.  
Special thanks to Endill for helping me understand how filters work. Btw, your software is awesome! Thx! It makes my work easier. I'm looking forward to updates. ;)  
And many thanks to all the Beatrice-Raws members. You’re the best. I love you! ^__^
